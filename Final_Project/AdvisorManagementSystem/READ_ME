This is an Advisor Management System

You can use by running Main in IDEA, or run AdvisorManagementSystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar which is in src/target file in CMD with command: java -jar AdvisorManagementSystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Someting to notice:

About log in:
You need to login first. The existing user accounts are: 
username: root
password: 123
and 
username: test
password: 123456

About the database:
If you want to check the cloud database online, you could go to "https://dms.cloud.tencent.com/#/login". 
Choose login by email: email is "huangly1@icloud.com" and password is "Hly2274807". 
Choose the "TDSQL-C for MySQL" for "类型(type)" and the account number and password are "root" and "Hly2274807".
I have already configured the connection with cloud database, which is due by 12/19/2022, in the mybatis-config.xml file. If it expires, I'll have to pay for another month, so I hope you could check my project by 12/19. Thanks!!!

About the log system:
when using this application, it will automatically log the operation you did, in the console.log file, which is in the root directory of the project. 
If you run the jar file via cmd, the console.log will be saved in the user directory in your computer, for me the directory is C:\Users\Lingyun.  

About the query and delete operation:
If there is no such object that matches your input, it will tell you.

About the test file in src
You don't need to check it. I use it to test some functions with JUnit. The codes you care the most is in src/main/java/advisor/manage, I think.
